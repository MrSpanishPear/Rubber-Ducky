## Goals

This script has three goals:
  * Get a reverse shell
  * Get sudo access
  * Inject a keylogger


## Achievements

Currently all the goals are met, and more! The rubber ducky downloads multiple shell scripts which add a fake sudo, give ssh access, open a keylogger and a script for creating a SUID exposed binary which we can use to privalge escalate once we have acieved root - in the case that the root password is changed. 

HD achieved :)
