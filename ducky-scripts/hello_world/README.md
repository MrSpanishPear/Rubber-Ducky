## Goal
Initial script for PS criteria, prints "Hello World" to a notes file (cannot assume a user has notepad)


## Achievments
Not only was I able to echo `"Hello World"` to the terminal, I was also able to open a notes file and echo it there as well. Additionally, I also wrote the code for the button - only to find out later that it wasnt an option. 


## Caveats
Unfortunately, was unable to connect the button to the rubber ducky. 

As a result of COVID I was unable to use the public makerspaces to solder the button on.
